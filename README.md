# Fourier-Transform-Fun
This is a small C++ project for experimenting with Fourier Transforms and complex number arithmetic. It focuses on implementing concepts such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Inverse DFT, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), and operations with complex numbers, all written from scratch and to the best of my knowledge.
