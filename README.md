# Fourier-Transform-Fun
This is a small C++ project for experimenting with Fourier Transforms and complex number arithmetic. It focuses on understanding and implementing core concepts such as the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT), Inverse DFT, Fast Fourier Transforms (FFT), and basic operations with complex numbers.
